		     README FILE FOR SPIM & XSPIM
		     ============================

This directory contains SPIM--an assembly language MIPS R2000/R3000
simulator.

		       BUILDING SPIM FOR UNIX SYSTEMS
		       ==============================

These instructions explain how to compile and install spim and xspim on a
Unix system.  It is not necessary to compile spim for PCs, as the web site
has precompiled versions.

To make SPIM, you must first run the Configure script:

	% Configure

Note: Configure compiles a program with the C compiler (cc).  If you want it
to use another compiler, set the environment variable CC to its name, e.g.:

	% setenv CC gcc


Next, edit the first few non-comment lines of Imakefile (or Makefile.std or
Makefile.cygwin, if you use one of those instead) to set the pathnames for
your system:

	EXCEPTION_DIR  -- The full pathname of the directory in which to
		     install the SPIM exception handler.

	BIN_DIR   -- The full pathname of the directory in which spim and
		     xspim should be installed.

	MAN_DIR   -- The full pathname of the directory in which the manual
		     pages for spim and xspim should be installed.

In general, the remaining parameters need not be changed.

Then, if using Imakefile type:

	% xmkmf
	% make

If you want an X-window version of SPIM, also type:

	% make xspim


If you do not have X-windows or the program xmkmf, edit the makefile in
Makefile.std or Makefile.cygwin and type:

	% make -f Makefile.std test
	% make -f Makefile.std xspim


To run spim or xspim, the exception handler code must be installed in the
directory specified by the variable EXCEPTION_DIR in the Makefile.  If the file
exceptions.s is not installed, spim and xspim fail with a message before
they start running.  You can either install this file by hand or by typing

	% make install

which also installs spim, xspim, and the manual pages in the directories that you set (above).


To test that spim is correctly built, type

	% make test

and examine the output of the test.  (Note: the exception handler must be
installed before running the test.)


			      SPIM ON WINDOWS
			      ===============

SPIM works well on Windows.  You can easily build spim (the non-windowing
version) using the Cygwin port of the GNU tools (see www.cygwin.com).  The
Windows version of spim is called PCSpim and is distributed through:

	www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html



			 NEW VERSIONS OF SPIM
			 ===================

I generally release new version of SPIM once a year, before a semester
boundary (late August or early January).  The new version are available
through:

		www.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html



The files in this directory are:

BLURB
	A short description of SPIM.

Configure
	A shell script to configure SPIM.

Imakefile
	Input file for the xmkmf program, which produces Makefile for your
	system.

Makefile.cygwin
	This makefile builds spim (but not xspim--use PCSpim instead) under
	the Cygnus Cygwin tools running on Windows.  Very cool and very
	convenient.

Makefile.std
	A default makefile.  Only use this file if you do not have xmkmf
	(see Imakefile).

		  WHAT ABOUT SPIM ON SYSTEM XYZ?
		  ==============================

SPIM should run without many changes on many Unix systems.  Obviously,
I have not tested SPIM on many system, nor can I port SPIM to systems
that I don't have.  However, I would like to hear about the changes
necessary to run SPIM on your favorite system.
